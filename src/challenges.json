However, sometimes a new policy on such documents and procedures is being adopted and promulgated right in the middle of this process, with an immediate effect, and often warrants some significant modifications be done to the already developed documents. How do we go about such a conflict of direction?  Do we stick to the current procedures or we redo the whole set of documents along with the lines of such a newly adopted policy?"

    "prompt": "These days people no longer talk to each other in person but rather communicate through emails, short message service and various web chat applications. This is not too bad as one can always trace an important conversation through this written record. However, face-to-face staff meetings and individual face-to-face discussions continue to play an important role. What is the best balance between these two ways of internal communication in a team of 20-30 staff?"
